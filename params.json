If you are using a Windows machine it is possible that you will need [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed to build and install the package. There is, however, no compiled code in SSLfish. \r\n\r\n### Using devtools\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the SSLfish package using the GitHub installation function within the devtools R package. If devtools is not installed, it can be installed from CRAN by typing `install.packages(\"devtools\")` from within the R console.\r\n\r\nIf devtools is installed (or after you have installed it), to install SSLfish, open the R console and type\r\n```\r\n> library(devtools)\r\n> install_github(\"SSLfish\", username=\"NMML\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Downloading a binary file\r\n\r\nIf you are using a Windows or Mac OSX machine, you can also download prebuilt binary files for installation. The Mac OSX version is available [here](https://github.com/NMML/SSLfish/releases/download/v0.11/SSLfish_0.11.tgz). The windows version is downloaded [here](https://github.com/NMML/SSLfish/releases/download/v0.11/agTrend_0.11.zip). If you are running a Linux machine, see the following section. *Note*: make sure your browser does not try to automatically unpack the file (this is the default for Safari, go into preferences to change this feature). \r\n\r\nAfter you download the file, open R and set the working directory (e.g., using `setwd(\"path/to/download/dir/\")`). Once this is set, run\r\n\r\n```\r\n> install.packages(\"SSLfish_0.11.zip\", repos=NULL)\r\n```\r\nIf you have a mac replace with \"SSLfish_0.11.zip\" with \"SSLfish_0.11.tgz\".\r\n\r\n### Downloading the source file\r\nSource files for each version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NMML/SSLfish/releases/download/v0.11/SSLfish_0.11.tar.gz). The desired file can be downloaded and installed in the same way as with the binaries, e.g., \r\n\r\n```\r\n> install.packages(\"SSLfish_0.11.tar.gz\", repos=NULL, type=\"source\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is it installed?\r\n\r\nHowever you choose to install you should see some output that, hopefully, ends with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* installing *source* package 'SSLfish' ...\r\n** R\r\n** data\r\n** demo\r\n** inst\r\n** preparing package for lazy loading\r\n** help\r\n*** installing help indices\r\n** building package indices\r\n** testing if installed package can be loaded\r\n* DONE (SSLfish)\r\n> \r\n```\r\nIn which case, everything is installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using SSLfish\r\n\r\nTo begin using SSLfish simply open the R console and type \r\n```\r\n> library(SSLfish)\r\n```\r\n \r\nFollowing this you should see this output:\r\n```\r\nLoading required package: gtools\r\n\r\n SSLfish 0.11 (2013-11-15) \r\n\r\n>  \r\n```\r\nIt will throw some errors if the required packages are not installed. Just install these separately using, e.g.,  `install.packages(\"gtools\")`. From here you can look at the code for running simulations. Type `?SSLfish` to get the help page index.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
